    Allow the creating of a domain with the additional, optional
    parameter of `explicit_domain_id` instead of auto-creating a
    domain_id from a uuid.

    When keeping two Keystone servers in sync, but avoiding Database
    replication, it was often necessary to hack the database to update
    the Domain ID so that entries match. Domain ID is then used for
    LDAP mapped IDs, and if they don't match, the user IDs are
    different. It should be possible to add a domain with an explicit
    ID, so that the two servers can match User IDs.
    The reason that the variable name is not simple `domain_id` is
    twofold: First to keep people from thinking that this is a required, or
    at least suggested field.  Second, to prevent copy errors when
    creating a new domain, where the domain_id would be copied in from
    the old one, and having spurious failures, or undesirecd domain_id
    matching.
