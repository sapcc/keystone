    [`bug 1872735 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1872735>`_]
    Fixed a security issue in which a trustee or an application credential user
    could create an EC2 credential or an application credential that would
    permit them to get a token that elevated their role assignments beyond the
    subset delegated to them in the trust or application credential. A new
    attribute ``app_cred_id`` is now automatically added to the access blob of
    an EC2 credential and the role list in the trust or application credential
    is respected.
