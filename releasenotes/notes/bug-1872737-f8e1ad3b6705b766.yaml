    [`bug 1872737 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1872737>`_]
    Added a new config option ``auth_ttl`` in the ``[credential]`` config
    section to allow configuring the period for which a signed token request
    from AWS is valid. The default is 15 minutes in accordance with the AWS
    Signature V4 API reference.

    [`bug 1872737 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1872737>`_]
    Added a default TTL of 15 minutes for signed EC2 credential requests,
    where previously an EC2 signed token request was valid indefinitely. This
    change in behavior is needed to protect against replay attacks.

    [`bug 1872737 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1872737>`_]
    Fixed an incorrect EC2 token validation implementation in which the
    timestamp of the signed request was ignored, which made EC2 and S3 token
    requests vulnerable to replay attacks. The default TTL is 15 minutes but
    is configurable.
