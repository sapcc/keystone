    [`bug 1872755 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1872755>`_]
    Added validation to the EC2 credentials update API to ensure the metadata
    labels 'trust_id' and 'app_cred_id' are not altered by the user. These
    labels are used by keystone to determine the scope allowed by the
    credential, and altering these automatic labels could enable an EC2
    credential holder to elevate their access beyond what is permitted by the
    application credential or trust that was used to create the EC2 credential.
