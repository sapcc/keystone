    [`bug 1872735 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/keystone/+bug/1872735>`_]
    Fixed the token model to respect the roles authorized OAuth1 access tokens.
    Previously, the list of roles authorized for an OAuth1 access token were
    ignored, so when an access token was used to request a keystone token, the
    keystone token would contain every role assignment the creator had for the
    project. This also fixed EC2 credentials to respect those roles as well.
